At the end of the performance, she dropped her microphone, unbuttoned her blazer and rubbed her stomach, confirming her pregnancy she had alluded to earlier in the evening. Her appearance helped that year\\'s MTV Video Music Awards become the most-watched broadcast in MTV history, pulling in 12.4 million viewers; the announcement was listed in Guinness World Records for \"most tweets per second recorded for a single event\" on Twitter, receiving 8,868 tweets per second and \"Beyonce pregnant\" was the most Googled term the week of August 29, 2011.', 'score': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'count': 347}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '41736eaf87e42d59b7a25a873f730daf'},\n",

MTV didn\\'t need that and Taylor and her family friends and fans definitely didn\\'t want or need that\" and concluding with \"I\\'m sorry Taylor.\" He also revealed he had written a song for Swift and if she did not accept the song, he would perform it himself. However, on November 8, 2010, in an interview with a Minnesota radio station, he seemed to recant his past apologies by attempting to describe the act at the 2009 awards show as \"selfless\" and downgrade the perception of disrespect it created. In \"Famous,\" a track from his 2016 album The Life of Pablo, West implies that this incident led to Swift\\'s stardom, rapping, \"I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/ Why?

After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group.
